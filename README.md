My First HTML Webpage 
----------------------
This is my Day 1 HTML project — the very beginning of my web development journey.
I threw together everything I learned today: basic tags, images, links, lists, etc.. 

 What’s in it:
 -------------
-A clean, simple HTML layout

-My first sections, headers, and structured page

-An image from Unsplash (because the vibes matter)

-A tiny bio and some fun lists

-All done using VS Code and pure HTML

Why I built it:
---------------
-Today was all about learning the basics.

-I wanted to make something small but real — something that shows I actually started.

Prerequisites:
---------------
To view or edit this project, you may need:

- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
  
- VS Code(only needed if you want to edit the HTML file)
